Client for webdash web socket server. Reads from stdin and passes the data
to the server.

Requires an X509 client authentication for each client.

Steps to generate:

1. Generate the key and create the CSR with

   openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout webdash-client-X.key -out webdash-client-X.csr

   Fill out the two fields Common Name and Email Address (although that might
   be unnecessary?) and leave all other blank. After that the private key is
   in file webdash-client-X.key (note: not protected by a passphrase, which is
   appropriate for us), and the key signing request including the public part
   in webdash-client-X.csr.

2. Get a certificate for the key from CAcert.org 

   Log into the CAcert.org website and use the menu client certificate | New.
   Check Show advanced options: to show the input field Optional Client CSR.
   Paste the complete contents of the file webdash-client-X.csr into the
   Optional Client CSR area. Then check the other options and finally click
   on Generate Certificate.

   Choose options (not sure whether "Enable certificate login with this
   certificate" is respected by the server, or something else must be done
   to prevent creation of a certificate which allows login to CAcert.org).
   Click on Generate Certificate. Save the resulting certificate to
   webdash-client-X.crt.

3. Install in webdsah

   The .csr file can now be deleted.  Place the .key and .crt files in
   the webdash client directory, and place the .crt file in the
   valid-client-certs directory for the websocket server.

4. Run with the new certificate

   webdash-client.rb wss:://<ip address or host>:8126 webdash-client-X.key webdash-client-X.crt
